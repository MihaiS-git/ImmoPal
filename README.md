Real Estate Auction App - Microservices

a real-estate auction web application using microservices architecture deployed in Docker containers. The frontend is implemented with Angular and the backend is implemented using Spring Boot, with technologies like Hibernate, Lombok and MapStruct, using both Maven and Gradle. The app is broken down into 9 microservices, each running in its own container. Databases are also decomposed for each microservice, whether they are relational databases PostgreSQL, whether they are no-SQL MongoDB databases, they have each the own container. Each microservice is decoupled from the other services in the system and has its own unique role. Thus, Gateway Service is implemented with the role of single entry point, Security Service deals with authorization and authentication, Agency Service deals with issues related to real estate agencies, Appointment Service with the management of appointments that can be set between agents and a customer involving a property, Auction Service manages the auctions, Person Service manages user's public information, Property Service manages property, Chat Service facilitates one to one communication between users, Email Service deals with sending emails to users for password recovery confirmation or for notifying the auctions winners.
